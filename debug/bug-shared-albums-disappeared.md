# Bug Report: Shared Album Disappears from Plugin Window

Hi there!

First of all, thank you for your work on the plugin. After the recent updates, I can now upload photos without any problem. However, I encountered a new issue: after creating a shared album, it disappears from the extra plugin window and I can no longer see or manage it from there.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Upload photos using the plugin (works fine).
2. Create a new shared album (see attached screenshots for details).
3. After creation, the shared album is no longer visible in the extra plugin window.

## Expected Result

The shared album should remain visible and manageable in the plugin window after creation.

## Actual Result

The shared album disappears from the extra plugin window immediately after being created.
